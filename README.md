# Neural Networks as Quantum States

A LaTeX presentation demonstrating the use of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) to represent quantum many-body ground states for the *Deep Learning with Applications* course @ UNIMI.

Made in tandem with [nnqs](https://github.com/stevelonny/nnqs) repo.

## Overview

This presentation explores how neural networks can address the exponential complexity of quantum many-body problems by learning compact representations of quantum states. The work is based on the groundbreaking approach by Carleo & Troyer (Science, 2017).
